## Running locally

These instructions allow to run locally to modify the sample.

### Setup

The following commands are a 1-time setup after synching the repo on your machine.

* install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* install the PXT command line
```
npm install -g pxt
```
* install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Running the local server

After you're done, simple run this command to open a local web server:
```
pxt serve
```

After making a change in the source, refresh the page in the browser.

## Updating the tools

If you would like to pick up the latest PXT build, simply run
```
pxt update
```

## Deploy to github pages

Run the following command to update the github page build of this editor

```

You can also minify it but it takes longer to generate:
